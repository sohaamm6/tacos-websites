                When Did The Tacos First Appear in The United States?
            </summary>
            <p>
                Tacos first appeared in the United States in the early 1900s when Mexican migrants moved to Los Angeles
                to work on railroads and other jobs12. The taco was seen as low-class street food due to how inexpensive
                they were13. The tacoâ€™s first mention in a U.S. newspaper was in early 19053. For some time after, the
                taco continued to be seen as a food for the lower classes, and in some regions it retained its
                designation as peasant food for several decades3.The earliest mention of tacos in the united states are
                in a newspaper from <time datetime="1905">1905</time>.(source:<cite><a
